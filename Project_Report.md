# Project Report

## Abstract
The Family Expense Calculation System is developed using ServiceNow to help families manage and track daily expenses efficiently. The system uses two custom tables: Family and Daily Expenses.

A one-to-many relationship is established between the tables. A Business Rule automatically calculates the total expense for each family whenever a new expense is added.
